# GDPLabs Automation Scripts

My personal automation scripts to make life in GDPLabs easier.

This repository is mostly a backup, the actual app runs in their own platform.

## Automation List

### WFO Day Synchronization

Synchronize WFO Bandung Sheet and GLAIR WFO Sheet from a weekly Slack form questionare.

The workflow lives directly as a Web App defined in Google Apps Script.

### Weekly Report

Weekly reporter as a n8n script. This repository only stores the exported backup.

Probably not n8n though

## License

Just steal it bro... No need for permissions or whatchamajit.
